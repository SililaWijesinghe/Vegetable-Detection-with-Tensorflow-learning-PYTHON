# Vegetable-Detection-with-Tensorflow-learning-PYTHON
One notebook trains a vegetable classification model with InceptionV3 using TensorFlow and Keras. The second notebook showcases the pre-trained model's inference on vegetable categories, loading InceptionV3 and enhancing image features. Together, they offer a compact solution for vegetable classification through deep learning.
